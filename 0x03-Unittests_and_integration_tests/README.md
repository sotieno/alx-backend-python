# Unittests and Integration Tests

In this project, I delve into the world of testing and gain hands-on experience with unittests and integration tests.

Testing is a critical aspect of software development that ensures the reliability and correctness of our code. Unittests and integration tests are essential components of a robust testing strategy, allowing us to validate individual units of code and the interaction between different components.

In this repository, you will find a curated set of mini-projects that focus on writing unittests and integration tests for various backend functionalities. Each project aims to provide practical insights and best practices for testing in a real-world application context.

## Learning Objectives

+ Understand the difference between unit and integration tests
* Understand common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures
